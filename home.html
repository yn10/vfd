    <h2>What is V.F.D.?</h2>
    <p>The V.F.D., or Volunteer Fire Department, is a secret and mysterious organization in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Series_of_Unfortunate_Events"><i>A Series of Unfortunate Events</i></a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_the_Wrong_Questions"><i>All the Wrong Questions</i></a>, which Violet, Klaus, and Sunny Baudelaire become increasingly more aware of and involved with after their first encounter with the villainous member Count Olaf. As the series continues, the reader learns that the organization, once whole and noble, has been divided by a schism between the followers of the organization's original principles, and those who follow principles completely opposed to the original V.F.D.</p>
    <p>The organization's insignia appears to be an eye made up of the letters “V,” “F,” and “D.” V.F.D. is the main international organization within the <i>Series of Unfortunate Events</i> books. Most of the recurring characters in said series are members.</p>

    <h2>History and activities</h2>
    <blockquote>“We believe in an aristocracy. Not an aristocracy of power, based on rank or wealth, but an aristocracy of the sensitive, the considerate, and the plucky. Our members are found in all nations and classes, and all through the ages, and there is a secret understanding between us when we meet. We represent the true human tradition, the one permanent victory over cruelty and chaos. We're an invincible army, but not a victorious one. We've had different names throughout history, but all the words that describe us are false, and all attempts to organize us fail. Right now we're called V.F.D., but all our schisms and arguments might cause us to disappear. It won't matter. People like us always slip through the net. Our true home is the imagination, and our kingdom is the wide-open world.”</blockquote>

    <h3>The Schism</h3>
    <p>Little is known about V.F.D.'s past before the split; Kit believes that it was a wonderful time of learning, though it is apparent that some volunteers apparently had child servants before the schism, implying that it may not have been as wonderful as volunteers such as Kit Snicket claimed it to be. Such examples might have been some of the initial differences between members that led up to the schism.</p>
    <p>The schism is an incident that occurred within V.F.D. that broke up the members into two sides: The <a href="fire.html">Fire-Starting side</a>, and the <a href="quiet.html">Fire-Fighting side</a>. As stated by Kit Snicket, those sides are literal and figurative. For example, the Fire-Starting side not only commits arson on certain occasions but generally causes panic and mayhem wherever they go, while the Fire-Fighting side not only works as a fire department literally, putting out fires, but also figuratively, by calming people down and making the world a quieter place. The way the schism was fought out is not known, but it's possible it was fought using various animals (including reptiles, birds, fish, and large carnivorous mammals), fire, water, and miscellaneous weaponry of sorts such as harpoon guns.</p>
    <p>It is noted that the schism began when Kit Snicket was four and the Denouement triplets were almost five, though it seems to have worsened as they grew older, as there is barely mention of a separation during Lemony's apprenticeship, but it has become a nearly insurmountable obstacle when the Baudelaires are orphaned.</p>
